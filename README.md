# Control_syncrhonous_motor



The project is separated in 2 parts

Part A: Modeling and symulation of the motor in open loop(without feedback) using rotoric coordinate system (Parks transformation), pole-zero analisis, transfer function analisis, feedback linearization.
Part B: Observability, Controlability, design of a Torque modulator and cascade controller (also modeling), robustnes, rlocus and pole-zero analysis, creating a desired command that can be reproduced without putting the machine in risk of braking it.
